Depthsensor.h library for Arduino. Allows for simple 2-way communication
between the Arduino and corrisponding python script running on the pc.

Start by creating a Depthsensor object (NOTE, initialize Serial to baud 9600 before using depth sensor)
	i.e.
		Depthsensor depthsensor;

Get Depthsensor value (Depthsensor object has float which can be accessed)
	i.e.
		Depthsensor.getDepth();
Check for incoming data from computer (place in loop())
	i.e.
		Depthsensor.serialUpdate();
