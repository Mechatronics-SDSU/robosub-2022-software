Killswitch.h library for Arduino. Allows for simple 2-way communication
between the Arduino and corrisponding python script running on the pc.

Start by creating a Killswitch object (NOTE, initialize Serial to baud 9600 before using killswitch)
	i.e.
		Killswitch killswitch;

Get killswitch state (Killswitch object has boolean which can be accessed)
	i.e.
		killswitch.getState();

Set killswitch state (Modifies boolean value stored in Killswitch object)
	i.e.
		killswitch.setState(true);
Check for incoming data from computer (place in loop())
	i.e.
		killswitch.serialUpdare();
