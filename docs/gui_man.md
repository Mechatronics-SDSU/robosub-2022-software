# GUI User Manual 

### About

##### Important note: This is not a breakdown for how the GUI works! This is an operator manual. See the gui_doc for code documentation.

The GUI was initially developed by Ian Reichard in the summer of 2021 for use with Pico. It was tested on a Raspberry Pi running docker containers similar to Pico's final architecture.
