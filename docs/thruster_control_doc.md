# Control Mappings

### Vectored thrusters motion layout

Scion uses 4 vectored thrusters angled at approximately 45 degrees to each other for X-Z axis translation and bearing adjustment. To program these thrusters for a variety of movement options, we first fit some of the common control methods to an xbox controller for manual piloting.

For manual pilot operation, the joysticks on the xbox controller are used to alter motion in the X-Z plane. The left joystick (LJ) controls forward and aft motion, along with strafing to port and starboard. Forward and aft motion are controlled with the Y-axis of the left joystick (LJ_Y), and port and starboard strafing are controlled with the X-axis of the left joystick (LJ_X). The right joystick (RJ) controls the bearing and is used to turn Scion. Currently only the X-axis of the right joystick (RJ_Y) alters bearing. 

The “DZ” referred to in the following images is the “dead zone” of the controller. This is a compensation for potential joystick drift.

The thrusters are notated as follows:

Note: Sometimes the ‘V’ is mislabeled in the following diagrams as a ‘Y’.

The following diagrams detail Scion’s movement with the control scheme.
